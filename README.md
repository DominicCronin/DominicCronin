Experienced lead developer, platform engineer and architect, with a preference for agile and devops; well-equipped to tackle difficult problems spanning diverse technologies. 

My work usually covers cloud native software development, devOps, platform engineering, problem solving, implementing customisations, designing infrastructure, or providing advice on architecture. Recently I've written code mostly in C# but I can turn my hand to several other languages, and I'm equally at home on a Windows Server or a Linux system. 

These implementations have usually required integrations with other systems within a solution architecture, and along with the lower level details, it's been important to have a view of the big picture. This has never been more true than in the highly automated devops systems we use today. I can help you with my in-depth knowledge and a multi-disciplinary view of how all the pieces fit together. I'm enthusiastic to share my knowledge and help your team skill up.

My specialities include: Platform engineering, DevOps, Content management, solution architecture, technical leadership, SDL Tridion (Web), DXA, .NET, C#, Java, JavaScript, Powershell, XML/XSLT, integrations, upgrades, migrations, agile methodologies. Microsoft Certified Azure Developer Associate. Microsoft Certified DevOps Engineer Expert, Microsoft Certified Application Developer, SDL Tridion Certified Developer, SDL Tridion Certified Architect, Certified Scrum Master. Awarded SDL Tridion Most Valued Professional every year from 2010 to 2021.
